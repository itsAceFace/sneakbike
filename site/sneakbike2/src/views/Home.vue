    <h1>What is Sneakbike?</h1>
    <p>Sneakbike is a series of events which are usually multi-runner races or showcases.</p>

    <p>There are a few standard events we have. Check these out below!</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Sneakbike Mystery Races</h2>

    <p>
      <b>Before the race...</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We choose two people to act as commentators and
        <b>have them pick three games (usually from NES, SNES, or Genesis) which people might not know about or have played before</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        For each of these games, we make an
        <b>objective</b> ("beat the first level", "kill the first boss", etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        We hide the names of the game and zip up a folder with the game roms and a TXT file which explains to the runners what the objectives are for each game. The runners get this
        <i>right before racing</i>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>During the race...</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The runner begins with
        <b>Game 1</b> and does that game's objective. When they're done, they go onto
        <b>Game 2</b> and do that game's objective. Last, they'll go on to
        <b>Game 3</b> and complete that game's objective.
      </li>
      <li>That's it!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sneakly Weekly</h2>

    <p>This is more of an "anything goes" event. In the past, we've had ALttP races, casual playthroughs of weird games together, or showing off a game that's kind of neat with a friend.</p>

    <p>If you have a neat idea and want to try it out, ask one of us and we'll most likely say something like, "Oh, cool, let's try that as a Sneakly Weekly."</p>

    <p>In other words, if the Sneakbike Mystery Races are a concert, Sneakly Weekly events are more like an open mic night.</p>
